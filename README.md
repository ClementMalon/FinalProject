Codes for the Computer Network Final Project directed by Mr.Pirahandeh
These two codes files allow a client to send a file to one or many other clients.
If the sender wants to broadcast the file, just enter the name of the file and press Enter. The broadcast is set by default.
However, if the sender wants to send the file to a specific client, he can do that by typing : @{SerialNumber of the user} {name of file}.
The server will make a copy of the file and send it to the specific user.

In the example below, the sender has broadcast a JPG file and we can see that the two other clients received it.
